# buddyfinder

A RESTful API for posting, browsing and expressing interest in excursions for the purpose of pairing up 'travel buddies'. Also handles registration and authentication. The Postgres DB location needs to be specified in the `application.properties` file, and the `db_setup` folder contains the required SQL to set up the database. More complete usage and set up documentation to follow.

This was an exploratory project, experimenting with different approaches to TDD and seeing how it informed architectural decisions within an API.

The application is currently being hosted on a free Heroku account, but may be shared here if/when I have arranged alternative hosting.
